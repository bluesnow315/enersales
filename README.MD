##Node API with Express, frontend with Angular 1.3.15
###Probably terrible learning project, I'm still figuring this angualar thing out.

##Getting Started
Install npm requirements
>npm install
Install bower requirements
>bower install
Then copy the config.js.example as config.js and set the required fields.
After that just run
>node server.js
and you should be in business.
